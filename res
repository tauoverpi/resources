Actor Model of Computation: Scalable Robust Information Systems
The Actor Model is a mathematical theory that treats “Actors” as the
universal primitives of digital computation.  The model has been used
both as a framework for a theoretical understanding of concurrency, and as
the theoretical basis for several practical implementations of concurrent
systems. The advent of massive concurrency through client-cloud computing
and many-core computer architectures has galvanized interest in the Actor Model

Formalizing common sense reasoning for scalable inconsistency-robust information integration using Direct LogicTM Reasoning and the Actor Model
People use common sense in their interactions with large information systems.
This common sense needs to be formalized so that it can be used by computer
systems. Unfortunately, previous formalizations have been inadequate. For
example, classical logic is not safe for use with pervasively inconsistent
information. The goal is to develop a standard foundation for reasoning in
large-scale Internet applications (including sense making for natural
language)

Bigraphical reactive systems: basic theory
A notion of bigraph is proposed as the basis for a model of mobile
interaction. A bigraph consists of two independent structures: a topograph
representing locality and a monograph representing connectivity. Bigraphs
are equipped with reaction rules to form bigraphical reactive systems (BRSs),
which include versions of the -calculus and the ambient calculus. Bigraphs are
shown to be a special case of a more abstract notion, wide reactive systems
(WRSs), not assuming any particular graphical or other structure but equipped
with a notion of width, which expresses that agents, contexts and reactions
may all be widely distributed entities
