Actor Model of Computation: Scalable Robust Information Systems
The Actor Model is a mathematical theory that treats “Actors” as the
universal primitives of digital computation.  The model has been used
both as a framework for a theoretical understanding of concurrency, and as
the theoretical basis for several practical implementations of concurrent
systems. The advent of massive concurrency through client-cloud computing
and many-core computer architectures has galvanized interest in the Actor Model

Formalizing common sense reasoning for scalable inconsistency-robust information integration using Direct LogicTM Reasoning and the Actor Model
People use common sense in their interactions with large information systems.
This common sense needs to be formalized so that it can be used by computer
systems. Unfortunately, previous formalizations have been inadequate. For
example, classical logic is not safe for use with pervasively inconsistent
information. The goal is to develop a standard foundation for reasoning in
large-scale Internet applications (including sense making for natural
language)

Bigraphical reactive systems: basic theory
A notion of bigraph is proposed as the basis for a model of mobile
interaction. A bigraph consists of two independent structures: a topograph
representing locality and a monograph representing connectivity. Bigraphs
are equipped with reaction rules to form bigraphical reactive systems (BRSs),
which include versions of the -calculus and the ambient calculus. Bigraphs are
shown to be a special case of a more abstract notion, wide reactive systems
(WRSs), not assuming any particular graphical or other structure but equipped
with a notion of width, which expresses that agents, contexts and reactions
may all be widely distributed entities

Wireless M-Bus Security Whitepaper
This work aims to analyse the security of the Meter Bus as specified
in the relevant International organisation for Standardization (ISO)
documentation. M-Bus has its roots in the heat metering industries and
was continuously adopted to fit more complex applications. M-Bus is the
communication bus of choice of several meter manufacturers and its applications
span from drive-by wireless meter reading over to meter-to-meter and mesh
networking to meter-to-collector communication. M-Bus implementations support
different media types such as power line carrier (PLC) or twisted-pair
bus. To avoid the wiring efforts at the distribution level, utilities,
metering companies and manufacturers tend to more frequently choose wireless
protocols for communication. Accordingly, the analysis will mainly concentrate
on M-Bus wireless based communication – wM-Bus

A General Neural Network Hardware Architecture on FPGA
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) plays an increasingly important
role in data sampling and processing industries due to its highly
parallel architecture, low power consumption, and flexibility in custom
algorithms. Especially, in the artificial intelligence field, for training and
implement the neural networks and machine learning algorithms, high energy
efficiency hardware implement and massively parallel computing capacity are
heavily demanded. Therefore, many global companies have applied FPGAs into
AI and Machine learning fields such as autonomous driving and Automatic
Spoken Language Recognition (Baidu) [1] [2] and Bing search (Microsoft)
[3]. Considering the FPGAs great potential in these fields, we tend to
implement a general neural network hardware architecture on XILINX ZU9CG
System On Chip (SOC) platform [4], which contains abundant hardware resource
and powerful processing capacity. The general neural network architecture
on the FPGA SOC platform can perform forward and backward algorithms in deep
neural networks (DNN) with high performance and easily be adjusted according
to the type and scale of the neural networks.

TagFS: A simple tag-based filesystem
TagFS is a simple yet effective tag-based filesystem. Instead of organizing files and documents in
a strict hierarchy (like traditional filesystems), TagFS allows users to assign descriptive attributes
(called tags) to files and subsequently locate those files by searching for tags of interest.

Clever Algorithms: Nature-Inspired Programming Recipes
Implementing an Artificial Intelligence algorithm is difficult. Algorithm
descriptions may be incomplete, inconsistent, and distributed across a
number of papers, chapters and even websites. This can result in varied
interpretations of algorithms, undue attrition of algorithms, and ultimately
bad science. This book is an effort to address these issues by providing
a handbook of algorithmic recipes drawn from the fields of Metaheuristics,
Biologically Inspired Computation and Computational Intelligence, described in
a complete, consistent, and centralized manner. These standardized descriptions
were carefully designed to be accessible, usable, and understandable. Most
of the algorithms described were originally inspired by biological and
natural systems, such as the adaptive capabilities of genetic evolution
and the acquired immune system, and the foraging behaviors of birds, bees,
ants and bacteria. An encyclopedic algorithm reference, this book is intended
for research scientists, engineers, students, and interested amateurs. Each
algorithm description provides a working code example in the Ruby Programming
Language.
